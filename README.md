This project analyzes online retail sales data and performs customer segmentation using Python and Tableau. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), I cleaned and aggregated the dataset at the customer level to compute Total Spend, Total Quantity Purchased, and Purchase Frequency. After standardizing the data, I applied K-Means clustering (k=3) to segment customers into Low-Spend Occasional Buyers, High-Spend VIP Customers, and Medium-Value Loyal Customers. The final clustered dataset was exported for visualization.

Two Tableau dashboards were created for insights:

Online Retail Sales Dashboard, which highlights key metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Top Products, Sales Trends, and Country-wise Revenue.

The Customer Segmentation Dashboard, which visualizes cluster behavior through metrics like Average Spend, Average Purchase Frequency, Cluster Size, and a Spend-vs-Frequency scatter plot, along with summarized behavioral insights for each customer segment.

This complete project shows my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning clustering, and business-focused dashboards that provide actionable insights.
